I’m Joseph, software engineer and freelance game developer.

Went to Madison Area Technical College for 2 years and got my associates degree, then transferred over to University of Wisconsin - Whitewater to complete my Bachelors. I finished with a Major in Computer Science and a minor in Media Arts and Game Design.

I'm currently working on a few projects of mine, the main one being Mini Putt, a game that my friends and I are developing. Link is below.

When I'm not working, you can find me exploring my hobbies, such as video games, board games, reading, and art.

If you're looking to reach me, you can contact me at jcy_y2000@hotmail.com

Though, for professional inquiries, contact me at josephcyang4459@outlook.com
