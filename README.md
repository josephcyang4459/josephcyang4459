- 👋 Hi there, I’m Joseph, just a guy making his way through life.
- 👀 I'm interested in a variety of things; Those things include: Board games, video games, reading, art, and software development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science fundamentals at UW-Whitewater. I'm also learning about how to make a game in Unity too, just for a personal project of mine.
- 💞️ I'd love to work on anything related to software development or art. I would also like to work on writing and story boards too, though I'll have to admit, I have no idea how to do that (but I'd love to learn!)
