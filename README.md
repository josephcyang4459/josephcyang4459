I’m Joseph, software engineer and freelance game developer.

Went to Madison Area Technical College for 2 years and got my associates degree, then transferred over to University of Wisconsin - Whitewater to complete my Bachelors. I finished with a Major in Computer Science and a minor in Media Arts and Game Design.

I'm currently working on a few projects of mine. Link is my itch.io account below.

When I'm not working, you can find me exploring my hobbies, such as video games, board games, reading, and art.

If you're looking to reach me, you can contact me at josephcyang4459@outlook.com
